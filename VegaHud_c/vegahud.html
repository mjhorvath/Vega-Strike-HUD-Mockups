			<h3>Keyboard Input</h3>
			<p>Keyboard input is much the same as VegaStrike HUD Mockup A. The difference is that some of the VDUs have been moved around. For instance, the "Specs" VDU has been moved to the center-left; and the "(Issue) Order" VDU has been moved to the center-right.</p>
			<h3>Minimal HUD Mode</h3>
			<p>Since many of the smaller indicators (match speed, auto targeting, groups, etc.) are still missing in this mockup, there is no minimal HUD mode. The HUD also looks a bit more sparse than the others as a result.</p>
			<h3>Tooltips</h3>
			<p>Some of the HUD elements have associated tooltips that can be viewed by hovering the mouse over the item.</p>
