KEYBOARD INPUT

Keyboard input is much the same as VegaStrike HUD Mockup A. The difference is 
that some of the VDUs have been moved around. For instance, the "Specs" VDU has 
been moved to the center-left; and the "(Issue) Order" VDU has been moved to 
the center-right.

MINIMAL HUD MODE

Since many of the smaller indicators (match speed, auto targeting, groups, 
etc.) are still missing in this mockup, there is no minimal HUD mode. The HUD 
also looks a bit more sparse than the others as a result.

TOOLTIPS

Some of the HUD elements have associated tooltips that can be viewed by 
hovering the mouse over the item.
