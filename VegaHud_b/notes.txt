NOTES/TO DO
- Use "dsp_radar2.png"; but, create a mask so that it blends into the background.
- Images should be converted from 8-bit to 32-bit transparency, where needed.
- Use vector graphics (SVG) wherever possible.
- Scroll-bars should be 16px wide.
- Create a display for attitude, as well.
- Text-input is 10pt Tahoma regular. Panel titles are 12pt Verdana bold. Button 
  icons are usually 16pt Webdings or Wingdings regular. Most everything else is 
  Haettenschweiler.
- Icons can't be antialiased for display on the web. But they should be for the 
  game (actually, in the ideal case, the icons should be of a simple enough 
  design that antialiasing isn't necessary).
- Need to work on the crosshairs, lead indicator, missle-lock LEDs/buttons, and 
  armor % displays.
- Damage display should light up when receiving damage.
