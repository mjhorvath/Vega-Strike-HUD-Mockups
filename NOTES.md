## VegaHud A
* Probably should require that a VDU be enabled before making a selection. This will definately be the case for keyboard input. However, I don't think this should be required when using a mouse.
* Should make it so that the first selection within each tab is highlighted by default. (keyboard input only?)
* Still need to show current date & time, location, and FPS.
* Need to code the actions.
* Need to figure out the order of actions for VDU 2, and whether they're done correctly.
* Note: the 'display' property of a container is inherited. Should test this further.
* Note: filter opacity is cumulative in Mozilla, but not in IE. By moving the individual panes outside the VDUs, the behavior will be the same in both programs.
* Scrollbar styling only works in Internet Explorer for now.
